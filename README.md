# Student Attendance and Monitoring System Using Face Recognition

This project leverages classroom surveillance cameras to automate attendance and monitor student behavior using CNN and KNN algorithms for face recognition. It detects mobile phone usage and analyzes student emotions, logging this data to generate weekly reports. This system saves time and money compared to manual attendance, assists teachers in understanding student engagement, and enhances classroom management. Current performance shows 60%-70% accuracy in emotion detection and 40%-50% in mobile phone detection, with potential for improvement through increased data and training.
